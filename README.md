## Description

I have made this for beginners at game development.

If you want to make a space shooter-style game, this would be a good starting point for you.


You could learn how to implement the below features.
- How enemies to be created randomly.

- Basic controller types to use on mobile devices.
(Keyboard, Virtual joystick, Touch and Drag)

- Collision detection.

- Basic weapon system.
(Straight, To the player, Missile)

- Various movement system.
(Straight, To the player, Circle, Zigzag)

- A little of particle systems.

- Some useful scripts.
(Singleton, Shuffle, Rotator, etc)

There are some detailed comments in source codes.

Feel free to ask me about the codes and bugs.
